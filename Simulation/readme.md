# Python Simulation
Primary files for running simulations are in this folder. Utility/library files are in the `sim/` subfolder (so Python will load them).

# Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pathos multiprocessing library

First install Python 3, then run the command `pip install numpy matplotlib pathos` to install the other libraries.
